			<p class="red1"><em><strong>The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing people who are active in the Yelp community and role models on and off the site. Elite-worthiness is based on a number of things, including well-written reviews, high quality tips, a detailed personal profile, an active voting and complimenting record, and a history of playing well with others.</strong></em></p>

			<p class="red3">I was born and raised in Queens (melting pot of the world!) and come from a mixed ethnic background.  My brother and I were exposed to food from varied cultures (including our own).  And unlike many children, we ate everything that was served to us and enjoyed everything we ate!</p>

			<p class="red3">This only evolved in adulthood as we increased our circles of friends and eventually the word "Foodie" was used by many to describe me to others.</p>

			<p class="red3">Some cringe at the term (not sure why?) while the rest of us consider it a like interest and use it as an excuse to bond. ("YOU'RE a Foodie too? We HAVE to hang out!  I could use a new Food Buddy and I've been craving ramen lately.")</p>

			<p class="red3">Eventually I discovered <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> and decided to not only use it to look up restaurant reviews, but to put my experiences to good use by adding to the reviews and photos of restaurants that I, myself relied on from others.</p>

			<p class="red3">At some point it came up that a couple of friends are Yelp Elite members, and one of them was honestly in total shock that I never heard of it.  ("What do you mean YOU aren't ELITE? You get invited to all these food and drink tasting events for FREE!")</p>

			<h2 id="head-drop4"><i class="fa fa-yelp" aria-hidden="true"></i>Other Yelp Events<i class="fa fa-yelp" aria-hidden="true"></i><div align="right"><i class="fa fa-level-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></div></h2>

			<p class="red4">There are also "Official Yelp Events" that are open to the everyone (not just Yelp Elite members).  Some are free, some require a ticket purchase.</p>

			<p class="red4">Sometimes other Yelp users submit events that are not sponsored by Yelp, so look for "Official Yelp Event" to be sure.</p>

			<h2 id="head-drop5"><i class="fa fa-yelp" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="https://www.yelp.com/events/new-york-new-york-techweek-2016" target="_blank">New York Techweek 2016</a><i class="fa fa-yelp" aria-hidden="true"></i>

			<p class="red5"><a href="http://techweek.com/newyork-schedule/" target="_blank">Techweek</a> is an example of an event that is not an Official Yelp Event but is listed in the "Festivals & Fairs" category.  It is a very popular event that draws a lot of interest, so Yelp promotes on it's events page and also offers a chance to win a ticket for free admission.</p>

			<p class="red5"><em><strong>"Techweek is back to New York for its 4th year; and we couldn't be more excited. Techweek New York launched in 2013 with a small and intimate attendee list of 500, while this year we are anticipating thousands. Techweek New York isn't your typical technology conference experience.  We are on a mission to support technology ecosystems - to bring together people, ideas and resources to ensure local technology ecosystems are enriched and develop. And we take this mission very seriously. Techweek New York 2016 happens over a week, and it happens in multiple locations: highlighting some of the headquarters, in-office charms, and culture of New York's emerging technology greats; and some of its very much emerged technology businesses too.  New York, get ready - we're coming back."</strong></em></p>
