			<h2 class="red">From Yelp Support Center:</h2>

			<p class="red">The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing people who are active in the Yelp community and role models on and off the site. Elite-worthiness is based on a number of things, including well-written reviews, high quality tips, a detailed personal profile, an active voting and complimenting record, and a history of playing well with others.</p>

			<h2 class="red">My Elite Story</h2>

			<p class="red">I was born and raised in Queens (melting pot of the world!) and come from a mixed ethnic background.  My brother and I were exposed to food from varied cultures (including our own).  And unlike many children, we ate everything that was served to us and enjoyed everything we ate!</p>

			<p class="red">This only evolved in adulthood as we increased our circles of friends and eventually the word "Foodie" was used by many to describe me to others.</p>

			<p class="red">Some cringe at the term (not sure why?) while the rest of us consider it a like interest and use it as an excuse to bond. ("YOU'RE a Foodie too? We HAVE to hang out!  I could use a new Food Buddy and I've been craving ramen lately.")</p>

			<p class="red">Eventually I discovered <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> and decided to not only use it to look up restaurant reviews, but to put my experiences to good use by adding to the reviews and photos of restaurants that I, myself relied on from others.</p>

			<p class="red">At some point it came up that a couple of friends are Yelp Elite members, and one of them was honestly in total shock that I never heard of it.  ("What do you mean YOU aren't ELITE? You get invited to all these food and drink tasting events for FREE!")</p>
