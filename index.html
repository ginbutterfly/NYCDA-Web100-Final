			<p>I may as well use this page as an excuse to open up a bit and explain <strong>WHY...</strong> Why am I doing this? Why, at this point in my life, take evening classes?  Why take on the late nights for classes and studying when I have a full-time career?</p>	

			<div class="image-right"><img src="images/addingmachine.jpg"></div>

			<p>Let's start with how I ended up an accountant. I graduated with a BS in Accounting in 2002.  It was a different world when I graduated college.  I didn't own a computer in college.  I would borrow a laptop from someone or use one of the computers in the library or at a friend's house.  </p>

			<div class="image-left2"><img src="images/writingpad.jpg"></div>

			<p>Exams and notes were hand-written in college.  Once working full-time, all my workpapers were printed to paper and stored in folders and binders.  I did most of my work on a PC, but everything was printed and ticked and tied manually, with the final product signed by hand mailed out via snail-mail.</p>

			<p>My first full-time position was supposed to be in audit.  Instead, I ended up getting a working at a CPA firm in tax after graduation. I thought, this isn't what I was hoping to do, but I can always try it and decide later if I want to do something else.</p>

			<p>Fast-forward through MANY late nights in the office to present day, 2016.  I'm still doing tax, but not in the CPA firm environment.  I'm now specialized in the alternative investment industry, where I'm analyzing securities and other investments for US tax treatment.</p>

			<p>Because I've been doing what I do for <strong>SO LONG,</strong> I feel like it's become an identity.  I've become a specialist in a specific field, but as a "specialist" I feel limited to what I actually know how to do after all the years since graduation.  I decided that there is <strong>SO MUCH MORE</strong> I can do with my talents if I learn new skills to complement the ones I already have.</p>
